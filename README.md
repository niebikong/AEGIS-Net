## Setups

All code was developed and tested on a single machine equiped with a Tesla V100 32GB GPU. The environment is as bellow:

- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- Python 3.10.13
- Pytorch 2.1.1
- faiss-gpu==1.7.2
- numpy==1.26.1
- pandas==2.1.3



## How to use

The code is currently tested only on GPU.

- Data preparation

  Preprocessing of the dataset is done at `Data_Proprecessing`.

  Created a folder `AEGIS-Net/dataset` and download `Malicious_TLS`/`CICIDS2017`/`CICIDS2017` into this folder.

- Source code

â€‹		If you 

```python
# Execute the following three files in sequence
1.python training.py

2.python extract_features.py

3.python Unknown_detection.py
```



```python
# Run at different noise rate
sh training.sh
```
